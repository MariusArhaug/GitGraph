## Configure env setup:

We use yarn as our package manager, in order to get the app to run av be up to date with the latest dependencies run:

`yarn install`

Downloads all the newest dependencies based on package.json

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

`yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Naming conventions

We use the following naming conventions:

- FEAT - For developing new feature
- CHANGE - Updating/modifying existing code
- DRAFT - For work in progress code
- DELETE - Removal off code (no additions)

Commit messages need to follow one of these four tags before additional message i. e:

`FEAT: add new component`

Same goes with branch names `FEAT/<issue number>`
