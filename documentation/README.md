## Why Axios?

Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client. It has all the basic functionalities required to do http requests from both node.js and the browser.\
We chose Axios over fetch because of:

- Ease of use, and previous experience with the technology.
- Cleaner code due to automatic JSON stringification when sending requests (not supported by the native Fetch API).
- Native protection against cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.
- Better error handling, and the ability to intercept, cancel, and timeout HTTP requests.

## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind is a highly customizable CSS framework.\
We chose to use Tailwind because of:

- Eliminates the complexity of traditional CSS styling and makes the code more maintainable.
- It's faster to write and makes consistentency in styling easier.

# API

Our API is implemented in [APIManager.tsx](./../src/content/APIManager.tsx)
. Here we're using Axios to request data from the [the GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html) with our own project as the target project.

The data we're fetching is:

- Contributors
- Issues
- Commits

The API key used to access this data is defined in a .env in the root directory of the project. As the API key is sensitive data this is not pushed to the repository.
The .env file should have the following format: `REACT_APP_GITLAB_API_KEY=[api-key]`

# CI (Pipeline)

A pipeline is a group of jobs that get executed in stages.\

1. Build stage defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\
   The building stage ensures that the code contains only valid TypeScript.
2. Test stage defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\
   The testing stage ensures that all tests are passed and returns a coverage report.
3. Linting stage defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\
   The linting stage ensured that the code does not contain errors conflicting with our ESLint rules.

Additionally, a coverage-badge in the GitLab repo is updated when the master branch is updated.

## Structure

Our website is using Axios to gathr data from GitLab's resource REST API. The response is in a form of a json object, with _TypeScript_ we can give these JSON values types and allow us to safely access values on these objects. In **APILoader.ts** all the main fetching functions lie. All stored within a single class object that allow us maintain state if we want, (not necessairly React state (useState etc)). The data is then loaded into _models_ that allow us to further manipulate data within the object encapsulation.

The main React component for the website is **Content.tsx** that further divides into main parent class components such as **UserList** and **IssueList** these components use the **APILoader** to load their nessecarry data when that component is created, this is done with **ComponentDidMount** and only occurs once.

### CI (Pipeline)

Pipeline first builds project, which should fail if invalid ts is pushed.  
The testing stage of the pipeline ensures all tests are passed and prints a coverage report in the console.
Upon pushing to master the coverage-badge in the GitLab repo is updated.
The eslint job checks that eslint doesn't throw any errors for the project.
